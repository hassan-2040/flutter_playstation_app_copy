# Playstation App Copy

A copy of PlayStation Mobile App Android UI

Features:

- Scroll Controller used to get real time scroll position and then Fade In/Fade Out AppBar using the scroll positions.

- TabBarView used to navigate only when profile screen is fully scrolled to the bottom.

- Home Button uses Fade and Rotate Animation on its icon.

- Home Button uses AnimatedContainer to expand/reduce a pop up menu, giving a feel of bottom sheet.

Note:
CustomPaint to draw a triangle in the loading widget has been copied from stackoverflow. I have yet to work with CustomPaint myself.
